#There is a syntax error in your code. The else statement should not have a condition (age < 18), and a colon (:) is missing after else. Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

age = float(input("Enter age: "))  
if age >= 18:  
    print("youngboy")  
else:  
    print("child")

#Let me know if you need further modifications!
